👋 Hi! I'm Caner, I'm a software engineer, and about to finish my PhD in Computer Science.

🧙‍♂️ I have expertise in compilers and programming languages, and distributed systems.

🛠️ My tech stack includes: Go, Python, Racket, C/C++, SQL/NoSQL, k8s, Docker, LXD, and more.

Worked full-stack at [Canonical](https://github.com/canonical) for over three years in the Enterprise Cloud Engineering ([Juju](https://github.com/juju/juju) team), where I worked on complex distributed systems.

Currently a post-proposal PhD candidate (all-but-dissertation) at Indiana University, Bloomington, specializing in Programming Languages (tracing JIT VMs). I also have an MSc in Computer Science, with a specialization in NLP and Machine Learning.

✨ I'm open to New Opportunities! Check out my [homepage](https://cderici.github.io/index.html) to see more!
